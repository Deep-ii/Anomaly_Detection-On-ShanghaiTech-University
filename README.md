# Anomaly_Detection-On-ShanghaiTech-University
This repository implements a zero-shot, vision–language-based anomaly detection system for surveillance videos. The approach leverages CLIP image–text embeddings, object-level analysis, and contrastive scoring to detect abnormal events (e.g., fights, vehicles, panic) in a university campus environment without training on abnormal samples.
